Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine used in the Chrome web browser and offers a powerful set of tools and libraries for building scalable, high-performance web applications.

Node.js has become popular for building real-time applications, web servers, and network tools due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that enables it to handle large numbers of simultaneous connections. It also has a vast ecosystem of third-party modules available through the Node Package Manager (NPM), making it easy to extend and customize applications.

Some popular use cases for Node.js include building APIs, handling real-time data streams, creating microservices, and building web applications with modern front-end frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular. With its flexibility, performance, and scalability, Node.js is a powerful tool for building a wide range of applications across various industries.
